# 3DS2 (3D Secure 2) Integration `[3DS2]`

This section covers integrating 3D Secure 2 (also known as EMV 3-D Secure) for Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), primarily for European transactions but increasingly relevant globally.

## Overview

_(Verify details against official '3DS2 Integration > Overview' documentation)_

3D Secure 2 provides an extra layer of security for online card payments. It involves collecting more data points during checkout (device info, browser details, transaction history - often handled by SDKs) to allow the cardholder's bank (Issuer) to perform a risk assessment.

- **Frictionless Flow:** If the risk is deemed low, the transaction is authenticated without requiring the cardholder to perform any extra steps.
- **Challenge Flow:** If the risk is higher, the Issuer presents a challenge to the cardholder (e.g., OTP via SMS, biometric confirmation via banking app) to verify their identity.
- **Benefits:** Reduces fraud, shifts liability for fraudulent chargebacks away from the merchant (for authenticated transactions), meets regulatory mandates (PSD2 SCA).

## Integration Methods

_(Verify details against official documentation)_

Fat Zebra offers different ways to implement 3DS2:

### Using Hosted Payments Page (HPP)

- **Process:** This is the simplest method. If you use Fat Zebra's HPP (e.g., via `renderPaymentsPage` in the JS SDK or direct redirect), Fat Zebra manages the entire 3DS2 flow (data collection, communication with the Issuer, challenge presentation if needed) automatically.
- **Configuration:** Usually requires enabling 3DS2 in your Fat Zebra Merchant Dashboard settings. Specific rules (e.g., enforce 3DS for all transactions vs. only when required by issuer) might be configurable.

### Using Custom Payments Form (API/SDKs)

This provides UI control but requires handling the 3DS flow explicitly.

- **Process Outline (Typical Flow):**
  1.  **Collect Data:** Use Fat Zebra's [JS SDK](./sdk.md#javascript-sdk) or [React SDK](./sdk.md#react-sdk) to collect card details via hosted fields. The SDK often collects necessary device/browser data automatically.
  2.  **Initiate on Server:** Send the card token (obtained from the SDK) and other purchase details to your server. Your server calls the Fat Zebra [Purchase API](./purchases.md), potentially including a flag to indicate 3DS should be attempted (e.g., `"three_ds": { "enabled": true }` - _confirm field_).
  3.  **Check API Response:** Analyze the response from the Purchase API call:
      - **Success (No 3DS Required/Frictionless):** If the transaction is approved directly (`"successful": true`), no further action is needed.
      - **3DS Challenge Required:** The response will indicate a challenge is needed (e.g., `"successful": false`, `"three_ds_required": true` - _confirm fields_). It will contain necessary data for the challenge (e.g., `three_ds_data` object with ACS URL, payload/JWT).
      - **Failure (Pre-Auth):** Transaction declined before 3DS (e.g., invalid card).
  4.  **Handle Challenge (Frontend):** If a challenge is required, pass the challenge data (`three_ds_data`) back to your frontend. Use the Fat Zebra JS SDK's `handle3DS()` method (or similar) to present the challenge flow (typically renders an iframe provided by the Issuer).
  5.  **Challenge Completion:** The SDK will notify your frontend code when the challenge flow completes (success or failure).
  6.  **Finalize/Verify (Server):** Based on the challenge outcome notified to your frontend, you might need to:
      - Call a specific Fat Zebra API endpoint to get the final transaction status using the original transaction ID or reference.
      - Or, rely on a [Webhook](./webhooks.md) notification (`purchase.succeeded`, `purchase.failed`) for the definitive outcome.
- **API Fields:** Key fields in API requests/responses might include:
  - Request: `three_ds: { enabled: true, ... (browser/device data if not using SDK) }`
  - Response: `successful`, `three_ds_required`, `three_ds_status` (e.g., `authenticated`, `failed`, `attempted`), `three_ds_data` (containing challenge info like `acs_url`, `creq` or similar).
- **JS SDK:** Essential for custom flows to handle device data collection and challenge presentation. Refer to the [SDK](./sdk.md#javascript-sdk) documentation for methods like `handle3DS()`.

Refer to the [Testing](./testing.md#3d-secure-simulation) section for test card numbers that trigger different 3DS outcomes (challenge, frictionless, failure).

## 3DS2 Outcomes

_(Verify outcome details and API mapping against official documentation)_

The final status of a 3DS enabled transaction will be reflected in the API response (potentially after a verification step) and/or webhooks.

- **Success (`successful: true`):**
  - **Authenticated:** 3DS completed successfully (either frictionless or via challenge). Liability shift generally applies.
  - **Authentication Bypassed:** Issuer or merchant rules allowed bypassing authentication (e.g., low-value transaction, exemption). Liability shift may _not_ apply.
  - **Authentication Attempted:** Authentication was attempted, but the outcome couldn't be confirmed (e.g., technical issue at Issuer). Liability shift generally does _not_ apply.
- **Failure (`successful: false`):**

  - **Authentication Failed:** Cardholder failed the challenge or explicitly cancelled.
  - **Card Not Enrolled / Unsupported:** Cardholder's bank doesn't support 3DS2.
  - **Other Decline:** Declined for reasons unrelated to 3DS (e.g., insufficient funds) either before or after the 3DS check.

- **API Mapping:** Look for fields like `three_ds_status`, `eci` (ecommerce indicator), or specific `response_code` / `message` values in the final transaction result to determine the precise 3DS outcome and liability implications.
