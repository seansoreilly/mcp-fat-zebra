## Notes on Test Results

1. **Payment Processing**: Basic payments, tokenized payments, and 3D Secure payments worked successfully.

2. **Refunds**: Successfully processed a refund for a transaction.

3. **Transaction Management**: Successfully retrieved transaction status, but could not retrieve transaction history.

4. **Batch Processing**: Successfully listed batches and retrieved batch details, but could not create new batches due to file handling issues.

5. **Customer Management**: All customer management functions (create, update, store card, list cards, delete card) failed, likely due to configuration issues or the test environment not supporting these features.

6. **Webhook Management**: All webhook management functions failed, likely due to the test environment not supporting webhooks.

7. **Custom API Requests**: Successfully made a custom GET request via the passthrough function.

## Next Steps

1. Investigate the "Unsupported content type" errors, which may indicate a formatting or payload issue.

2. Check if customer management features are enabled in the test environment.

3. For file upload functionality (create_batch), implement proper file handling.

4. Test webhook functionality in a properly configured environment.

5. Setup proper error handling for "Not Found" and "Record not found" errors in the application.

6. Consider implementing retry logic for intermittent failures.
