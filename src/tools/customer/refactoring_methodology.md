# Fat Zebra Payment Tools Refactoring Methodology

## Overview

This document outlines the methodology used to refactor the Fat Zebra payment tools from the old class-based implementation to the new object-based structure. The refactoring was performed to ensure consistency across all tools in the codebase, following the pattern established in `FatZebraPassthroughTool.ts`.

## Refactoring Process

### 1. Analysis Phase

1. **Examined the Target Structure**: 
   - Analyzed `FatZebraPassthroughTool.ts` to understand the new object-based structure
   - Identified key components: name, description, schema, and execute function
   - Noted the response format using content with type and text

2. **Examined the Original Tools**:
   - Analyzed the payment tools in `src/tools_old_reference/payment/`:
     - Payment processing tools
     - Refund tools
     - Payment status tools
   - Identified their functionality, inputs, and outputs
   - Noted they were using a class-based approach extending the Tool class

3. **Identified Key Differences**:
   - Class-based vs. object-based implementation
   - Schema format differences (nested objects vs. direct zod schemas)
   - Response format differences (direct return vs. content with type and text)

### 2. Implementation Phase

1. **Created Directory Structure**:
   - Ensured the target directory `src/tools/payment/` existed

2. **Refactored Each Tool**:
   - Converted from class-based to object-based implementation
   - Updated schema format to use zod directly with describe() method
   - Modified the response format to return content with type and text
   - Added proper error handling and logging with tool-specific prefixes
   - Maintained the same API endpoints and parameters
   - Preserved all original functionality

3. **Updated Index File**:
   - Modified `src/index.ts` to import and register the new payment tools
   - Used the same pattern as the existing FatZebraPassthroughTool registration

### 3. Verification Phase

1. **Compiled the Code**:
   - Ran TypeScript compiler (tsc) to check for type errors
   - Ran npm build command to ensure the build process completed successfully

2. **Reviewed Documentation**:
   - Examined the documentation in the docs directory
   - Compared the implementation against the API requirements
   - Verified all required fields according to documentation were properly implemented

3. **Final Verification**:
   - Performed a final check to ensure no fields were missed
   - Ran the build process again to confirm everything worked correctly

## Key Transformations

### Schema Transformation

**Original (Class-based):**
```typescript
schema = {
  amount: {
    type: z.number(),
    description: "The amount to charge in cents.",
  },
  // Other fields...
};
```

**Refactored (Object-based):**
```typescript
schema: {
  amount: z.number().describe("The amount to charge in cents."),
  // Other fields...
},
```

### Response Transformation

**Original (Class-based):**
```typescript
return {
  successful: true,
  transaction_id: transactionId,
  // Other fields...
};
```

**Refactored (Object-based):**
```typescript
return { 
  content: [{ 
    type: "text", 
    text: JSON.stringify({
      successful: true,
      status: response.status,
      response: {
        transaction_id: transactionId,
        // Other fields...
      },
      errors: undefined
    })
  }]
};
```

## Conclusion

The refactoring process successfully transformed the payment tools from a class-based implementation to an object-based structure matching `FatZebraPassthroughTool.ts`. The refactored tools maintain the exact same functionality as the original tools while following the new structure pattern, ensuring consistency across the codebase.
