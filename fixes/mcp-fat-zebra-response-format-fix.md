# MCP Fat Zebra Response Format Fix

## Issue Description

The MCP Fat Zebra server was encountering validation errors when returning responses from its tools. The errors were related to the response format not conforming to the MCP protocol's expected structure.

### Error Details

```
Failed to call_tool 'fat_zebra_3d_secure' on server 'fatzebra': 6 validation errors for CallToolResult
content.0.TextContent.type
  Input should be 'text' [type=literal_error, input_value='error', input_type=str]
content.0.ImageContent.type
  Input should be 'image' [type=literal_error, input_value='error', input_type=str]
```

The root cause was that the MCP framework's `BaseTool.js` has a `createErrorResponse` method that returns content with `type: "error"`, but this type is not recognized by the MCP protocol which only accepts `type: "text"`, `type: "image"`, or `type: "resource"`.

## Solution

The fix involved modifying the `FatZebra3DSecureTool.ts` file to ensure that all responses (including error responses) use the correct content structure and type values:

1. Updated the success response format to include a properly structured content array with objects having `type: 'text'`
2. Updated the error response format to follow the same pattern but with an additional `isError: true` property
3. Kept the original JSON data but wrapped it inside the properly structured MCP response format

### Implementation

```typescript
// Return the error response with proper MCP format
return {
  content: [
    {
      type: "text",
      text: JSON.stringify({
        successful: false,
        errors: data.errors || ["Unknown error from Fat Zebra API"],
      }),
    },
  ],
  isError: true,
};
```

### Before and After

**Before:** Tools returned plain JavaScript objects with properties like `successful`, `errors`, etc.

**After:** Tools return objects that conform to the MCP protocol requirements:

- With a `content` array containing objects with `type: 'text'` (for text content)
- With `isError: true` added to error responses
- JSON-stringified data for the actual response payload

## Testing

The fix was tested by running the Fat Zebra agent and successfully executing a 3D Secure payment. The payment was processed correctly, confirming that our fix resolved the validation error.

## Next Steps

Similar changes should be applied to all other tools in the MCP Fat Zebra server that may be returning responses in the incorrect format. This includes approximately 18 tools identified through code analysis, such as:

- Webhook tools
- Transaction tools
- Payment tools
- Card tools
- Batch tools
- Customer tools

## Implementation Strategy

1. Update each tool to wrap its response in the proper MCP format with `content` array
2. Ensure all error responses include `isError: true`
3. Use `type: 'text'` for textual responses
4. JSON stringify any complex data

This approach ensures compliance with the MCP protocol's validation requirements while maintaining the original functionality of the Fat Zebra tools.
