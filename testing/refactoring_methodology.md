# Fat Zebra Tools Refactoring Methodology

## Overview

This document outlines the methodology used to refactor the Fat Zebra tools from class-based implementation to object-based structure, following the pattern established in `FatZebraPassthroughTool.ts`.

## Refactoring Process

### 1. Analysis Phase

1. **Examined Target Structure**: 
   - Analyzed `FatZebraPassthroughTool.ts` to understand the object-based structure
   - Identified key components: name, description, schema, and execute function

2. **Examined Original Tools**:
   - Analyzed tools in `src/tools_old_reference/` directories:
     - Card tools (3): Store, List, Delete
     - Payment tools (6): Payment, Refund, TokenPayment, Tokenize, 3DSecure, DirectDebit
   - Identified functionality, inputs, and outputs

3. **Identified Key Differences**:
   - Class-based vs. object-based implementation
   - Schema format differences (nested objects vs. direct zod schemas)
   - Response format differences (direct return vs. content with type and text)

### 2. Implementation Phase

1. **Created Directory Structure**:
   - Ensured target directories existed (`src/tools/card/` and `src/tools/payment/`)

2. **Refactored Each Tool**:
   - Converted from class-based to object-based implementation
   - Updated schema format to use zod directly with describe() method
   - Modified response format to return content with type and text
   - Added proper error handling and logging with tool-specific prefixes
   - Maintained same API endpoints and parameters

3. **Updated Index File**:
   - Modified `src/index.ts` to import and register all new tools
   - Used consistent registration pattern

### 3. Verification Phase

1. **Compiled the Code**:
   - Ran TypeScript compiler to check for type errors
   - Verified build process completed successfully

2. **Reviewed Documentation**:
   - Compared implementation against API requirements
   - Maintained original functionality even where documentation differed

## Key Transformations

### Schema Transformation

**Original (Class-based):**
```typescript
schema = {
  field_name: {
    type: z.string(),
    description: "Field description",
  },
};
```

**Refactored (Object-based):**
```typescript
schema: {
  field_name: z.string().describe("Field description"),
},
```

### Response Transformation

**Original (Class-based):**
```typescript
return {
  successful: true,
  data: value,
};
```

**Refactored (Object-based):**
```typescript
return { 
  content: [{ 
    type: "text", 
    text: JSON.stringify({
      successful: true,
      status: response.status,
      response: {
        data: value,
      },
      errors: undefined
    })
  }]
};
```

## Conclusion

The refactoring process successfully transformed all tools from class-based implementation to object-based structure. The refactored tools maintain the same functionality while following the new structure pattern, ensuring consistency across the codebase.

In total, 9 tools were refactored:
- 3 card tools (Store, List, Delete)
- 6 payment tools (Payment, Refund, TokenPayment, Tokenize, 3DSecure, DirectDebit)
