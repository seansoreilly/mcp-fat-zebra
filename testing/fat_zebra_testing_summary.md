# Fat Zebra API Testing Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the testing results for the Fat Zebra payment gateway integration, focusing on the card tokenization functionality. Tests were conducted on April 21, 2025.

## Findings

### API Response Structure
According to the Fat Zebra documentation, all API responses follow this structure:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| successful | Boolean | Defines whether the request was valid |
| response | Object/Array | The scalar or vector serialization of records, depending on the context of the request |
| errors | Array of strings | List of errors encountered when processing the request |
| test | Boolean | Indicates whether or not the request was made in test mode |

### Tokenization Endpoint
- The correct endpoint for tokenizing credit cards is: `/v1.0/credit_cards`
- This endpoint accepts POST requests with JSON payload

### Testing Results

#### Using `fat_zebra_store_card` function:
```json
{
  "successful": false,
  "status": 200,
  "response": null,
  "errors": ["Customer ip can't be blank"]
}
```

#### Using `fat_zebra_passthrough` function:
```json
{
  "successful": false,
  "status": 404,
  "response": {"successful": false, "response": {}, "errors": ["Not Found"]},
  "errors": [["Not Found"]]
}
```

### Issues Identified

1. **Missing Required Parameter**: The `fat_zebra_store_card` function doesn't support the `customer_ip` parameter, which is required by the API.

2. **Endpoint Configuration**: Consistently receiving 404 "Not Found" errors when using the passthrough function, suggesting:
   - Incorrect base URL configuration
   - API authentication issues
   - Possible routing misconfiguration

3. **API Access**: Unable to successfully connect to any endpoint using the passthrough method, indicating potential issues with:
   - Authentication credentials
   - API permissions
   - Network/firewall configuration

### Sample Request Format
Based on Fat Zebra documentation, a proper tokenization request should look like:

```json
{
  "card_number": "5123456789012346",
  "card_holder": "Test User",
  "card_expiry": "05/2030",
  "cvv": "123",
  "customer_ip": "127.0.0.1"
}
```

### Recommendations

1. **Update Function Definition**: Modify the `fat_zebra_store_card` function to include the `customer_ip` parameter.

2. **Verify API Configuration**:
   - Confirm the correct base URL is configured
   - Ensure proper authentication credentials are being used
   - Check API access permissions

3. **Test With Postman/cURL**: Test direct API access using tools like Postman or cURL to isolate whether the issue is with the Fat Zebra API itself or the integration.

4. **Review Server Logs**: Examine any available server logs for the Fat Zebra integration to identify specific errors or connection issues.

5. **Contact Fat Zebra Support**: If issues persist, reach out to Fat Zebra support with specific error messages and test case details.

## Next Steps
- Implement recommendations above
- Perform additional tests with modified parameters
- Document successful test cases for future reference
